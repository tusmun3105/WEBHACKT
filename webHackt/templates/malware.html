                            <h2 class="text-white mb-4">What is Malware?</h2>

                            <p class="text-white" style="text-align:justify;">Malware refers to any software designed to have a malicious purpose once deployed to a computer or network. Malware infection typically occurs without a user's knowledge, often because it camouflages itself as a different file type such as an image or PDF file.</p>

                            <p class="text-white" style="text-align:justify;">This type of software can affect both desktop and mobile devices. It can serve various purposes, from stealing information to spying on keystrokes and even using a computer's hardware to mine cryptocurrency.</p>

                            <p class="text-white" style="text-align:justify;">All viruses are malware, but not all malware is a virus. Computer viruses gained that moniker because one can replicate itself and infect other machines, just like how a medical virus can affect human beings it comes in contact with. Certain types of malware are very targeted and don't fall into the virus category. They aim to control the specific machine or network they are installed on to achieve some other objective. In some cases, malicious software can be exponentially more difficult to detect and eliminate as it may only operate in the background.</p>

                            <h2 class="text-white mb-4">How Serious is Malware?</h2>

                            <p class="text-white" style="text-align:justify;">While there are several different forms of malware, all of them should be considered serious threats. Malware that shows you annoying pop-up ads or slows down your machine (often, this results from attackers mining hardware for cryptocurrency may be the least damaging. However, other examples of malware can still have dire long-term effects on your sensitive information and devices. The most severe malware threats are posed by software that silently monitors activity and logs keystrokes, potentially leading to stolen credit card info or, even worse, industrial espionage.</p>

                            <h2 class="text-white mb-4">How Common is Malware?</h2>

                            <p class="text-white" style="text-align:justify;">Malware is hugely prevalent. According to the AV Test Institute, there are over 1 billion malware programs installed around the world. Furthermore, among the most common types of malware, over 560,000 new pieces are detected daily.
                                The rate at which certain types of malware multiply makes them a potent foe for even the most seasoned IT professionals. The repeated successes of malware attacks mean there are no shortages of malicious actors ready to unleash them.
                                Most malware takes advantage of vulnerabilities in systems and applications to be effective. With computer, mobile, and smart connected device usage continuing to increase exponentially, cyber attackers have no shortage of options when it comes to infecting and compromising tech with malware.
