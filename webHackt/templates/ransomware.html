                            <p class="text-white" style="text-align:justify;">Malware refers to any software designed to have a malicious purpose once deployed to a computer or network. Malware infection typically occurs without a user's knowledge, often because it camouflages itself as a different file type such as an image or PDF file.</p>

                            <p class="text-white" style="text-align:justify;">This type of software can affect both desktop and mobile devices. It can serve various purposes, from stealing information to spying on keystrokes and even using a computer's hardware to mine cryptocurrency.</p>

                            <h2 class="text-white mb-4">How Ransomware Works?</h2>

                            <p class="text-white" style="text-align:justify;">Ransomware is a type of malicious software that threatens to release or block
                                access to data or a computer system by encryption until the victim pays a
                                ransom fee in cryptocurrency tokens or fiat money. Usually, there is a fixed
                                deadline for payment of the ransom. If the deadline is not met, the data may
                                be released or the ransom fee may be increased. Ransomware has been
                                used as far back as 1989 when the AIDs virus was used to extort money from
                                victims, who mailed the money via Panama to the cyber criminals.
                                In 2005, the first cases of cyber extortion through blackmail were reported in
                                Russia. Over the years, Ransomware use has spread widely among hackers,
                                especially since the adoption of cryptocurrency. In 2011, there was a marked
                                increase in the rate of ransomware attacks. Sometime in the year 2016, more
                                attacks were noticed and antivirus software took on more designs to focus
                                viral scanners on ransomware. Since then, ransomware attacks have evolved
                                in different ways to trick victims into paying for access to their own data.</p>

                    <div class="col-lg-6 col-12 mb-4 mb-lg-0 d-flex align-items-center">
                        <div class="services-info">
                            <h2 class="text-white mb-4">How Ransomware Works</h2>

                            <p class="text-white" style="text-align:justify;">Ransomware is installed by finding loopholes in your data security system and
                                exploiting them. One method Ransomware employs is the use of phishing:
                                basically sending scam emails that convince victims to release administrative
                                control or access to sensitive data. Once access is given, some or all of the
                                victims files are encrypted and the victim loses data access. The files can only
                                be decrypted with a mathematical key known to the attacker. The victim
                                receives a message demanding for an untraceable payment to enable the
                                attacker to decrypt the file and restore access.
                                Another way Ransomware works is by exploiting the remote desktop protocol
                                (RDP). An attacker can use RDP to successfully access and authenticate
                                enterprise data after guessing and entering employee passwords. The data is
                                accessed remotely on a computer within the enterprise network.
                                Subsequently, the malware is downloaded and executed on the machine
                                under the attacker's control. Access is gained and original files are replaced
                                with encrypted versions. In some cases, original files are deleted so that the
                                only available files are encrypted. This leaves the victims with no choice than
                                to pay the ransom. Other ransomware attacks may be direct or involve other
                                social engineering techniques like sending a fake law violation  notification
                                from a government agency and demanding a fee. The bottom line is that
                                
                                Ransomware attacks generally involve installing malicious software,
                                encrypting files and collecting ransoms.</p>

                            <h2 class="text-white mb-4">The Dangers of Ransomware?</h2>

                            <p class="text-white" style="text-align:justify;">The obvious consequence of falling victim to ransom attacks is monetary loss:
                                however, there are many more dangers that could result from having
                                ransomware on your system. The worst result of Ransomware is the data loss
                                that occurs: hackers can encrypt multiple files, rendering them useless. This
                                can negatively affect your business, especially if sensitive customer data or
                                organization information. If your customers find out that your database has
                                been compromised, they will lose trust in your business and switch to your
                                competitors. Your reputation as an organization may be destroyed, and in
                                some countries you may face legal implications.
                                The costs of a Ransomware attack are beyond financial, even though in most
                                occasions the ransoms involved are expensive and paying them may cause
                                an organization to shut down. Personal and organization devices may also
                                malfunction after a Ransomware attack, contributing to increased IT costs for
                                your organization. These devices can also be hacked to obtain credit card
                                data and login information for more fraudulent activities. Once a Ransomware
                                attack occurs, your data system becomes more vulnerable to more attacks. To
                                ensure reduced risk of repeat attacks, your organization has to spend more in
                                strengthening cybersecurity defenses. Devices may be replaced and
                                employees may be made to undergo cybersecurity training, increasing costs
                                and reducing work productivity in your organization.
